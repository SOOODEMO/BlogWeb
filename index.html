I think Niagra Falls is a very welcoming area because people from US sometimes comes to Niagra Falls and visits and I think it's really nice having more people coming to Niagra Falls.</p>

  <p>Many of the people hyping this movie up arent comic book fans and don't understand what they saw. It's no dissing at all but to see this movie getting 5 stars is insane it's not remotely that good no Marvel movie is.You can tell this movie was insanely rushed and wanted to get rid of big names to save money. It felt like they wanted to be seen as with the "times" and it worked because you see the reviews. Let's start off with the plot of it all Thanos snaps half of life out. We all know anyone with a functional brain should know that makes no sense. His logic contains so many plot-holes in it as that's not his reasoning in comics. His ideology was so stupid that anyone in the grade 6 should understand. But I see people saying Thanos is some amazingly written character. You then face with another issue in the story half of the lives are gone it takes off so many years after the snap. Life should basically be back to normal it makes no sense how life wouldn't be back to normal to an extent. We then see most of the core group because obviously all the Original Avengers wouldn't be affected by the snap. We see BlackWidow leading everything. instead of making this movie, they should've dropped solo movies that would have been more interesting and shown what life was like. But obviously, Disney is too money-hungry to make really good art. So people like ManApe were ok with letting Shuri rule Wakanda but the whole time he wanted to rule beforehand? Hulk and Banner come together that would've been interesting to see how ? Do you see it nope Hawkeye becomes a hitman a huge arc in his story Do we see what he does? Nope Captain  Marvel in the universe so after all these years in the snap where was she exactly? They tried to explain it off as "Not everywhere has a avengers". But it feels like you should've at least checked on friends and family? Tony has one of the scenes of "Is he going to help or is he going to be mean" like everyone didn't already know. What was up since it had no situation where your wondering the snap doesn't really matter out of a few camera angles and what they say you dont really see much. We then see them track Thanos to get the stones back we obviously knew it wasn't going to be that easy. But here comes a plot hole to the story Thanos destoried the gems? So how did Thanos think his plan was going to work after so many years the world is refilled with life? So after 10 or so more years then everything would be the same and would ruin his idea of "balance". And this time he cant use the stones to snap the life away so what happens next? We then see Thor kill Thanos and then suffers from PTSD. The fat thor bit literally got disrespectful to people who suffers from PTSD. Thor becomes fat as a way to deal with seeing half of his people killed and his brother. But the story cracks jokes about it and until he sees his mother its skipped past and no one cares? Seems like a prime example of if its a man going through it who cares. The fight scenes are until the end are lackluster I could tell you one out of the ending if you put it on my life. Only other remote fight scene I can name is Cap vs himself and that's only because of the America ass joke. Anything else was basically not needed I'm ok with dialogue if its done right but they didn't even do that right because at the end it becomes nothing. I can name more problems with this movie but I dont want to write a essay on what makes this movie bad.</p>

  <p>I've genuinely never come out of a movie feeling so bitter, disappointed and angry.
    Be prepared, for two hours of disappointment!
    Be prepared for a sensational fail!
    
    (Spoilers and basically just anger ahead)
    
    Seriously. Every dramatic moment was rushed through. No dramatic pauses, no moments or time of realisation that simba is alive. They removed important scenes (rafiki and his stick, simba realizing how big his dads footprint was and how much he needed to grow, simba actually defending himself properly against scar in the end etc.) and dialogue (Scar, BROTHER, help me. Who are you? How do you know me? Murderer, etc. )only to replace the scenes with showing off how well they render water, or grass, or animals that add nothing to the story. The dialogue was 4th wall breaking and extra fart/poop jokes.
    
    Simba seeing his dad in the clouds? Too hard to do, just look at the clouds for a bit. Simbas big roar at the end? Mistimed and went early, ruining the suspence. Plus loss of him dramatically walking up pride rock. Pumba running from nala and it being funny? Gone. The magic of rafiki being surprised simba is alive? Gone. Well all of rafiki, gone. Funny zazu quotes? Gone. Ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts? Gone. MR.Pig joke replaced with a "be proud to be fat" joke. 
    
    All the characters were stripped of their personalities or given more annoying ones. Timone is straight up a horrible per...meerkat. Pumba/nala aren't characters, theyre literally just beyonce and seth rogan. Rafiki was pointless, he taught simba nothing and really had no need to be in the film. He was bland. Zazu was not funny, he lost his sarcasm and became much too serious.  Scar lost anything that made him seem clever or sinister. He was a weak mess that even the hyenas were not afraid of.
     The hyenas were either annoying or serious. Couldnt possibly have a mentally challenged hyena could we? Could be offensive. Simba was a mopey spoilt kid who learnt nothing. He had no personality apart from stupidity, came across like malfoy. No power, just a mummys boy. "Get away from my mother!" Came off as just sort of pathetic.
    
    Only thing it has is amazing cgi.
    
    This is much more of a rant than a review but sadly i cant wipe my memory. Go watch the original. This one isn't worth the time.</p>
